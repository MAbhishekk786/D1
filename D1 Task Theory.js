//Difference Between HTTP1 & HTTP2

//While HTTP1 loads multiple requests for every TCP connection, 
//HTTP2 avoids network delay by multiplexing. 
//HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if 
//there is less network delay then the page loads faster. 
//However, an impressive increase in network bandwidth has negatively impacted HTTP2.

//In Javascript, objects may be defined as 
//an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
